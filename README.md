# Patika.dev - JavaScript Assian Kitchen Menu
This is part of a front-end course I'm currently taking on the [patika.dev](https://app.patika.dev/) platform.
It's a simple to-do app using vanilla React. All the comments are written in Turkish.

## Install
First, clone the repository into your local workspace:
```
    git clone https://github.com/alpyesil/JS-ILE-ASIAN-KITCHEN-MENU.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:
```
    cd JS-ILE-ASIAN-KITCHEN-MENU
```

Finally, run the project in development mode:
```
    index.html => live server
```
